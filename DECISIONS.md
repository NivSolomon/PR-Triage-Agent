## 1. The problem, the user, and why an agent

**Who uses it:** a small engineering team (about 5 people) that has a steady flow of open pull requests.

**What it makes easier:** answering "what should we review first, and why?" without opening every PR,
checking CI by hand, and reading review threads.

**Why an agent and not a dashboard:** the useful answer combines several sources (PR metadata, CI check
runs, review state, comments) and needs judgment ("this one blocks others", "this failure looks flaky").
A dashboard can list; it cannot explain, and it cannot draft a comment that a human then approves.

## 2. Assumptions

- One repository per deployment, configured by `GITHUB_REPO`.
- Telegram is the chat channel; a small web page shows the same queue and pending approvals.
- Approvers are a fixed allowlist of Telegram user ids.

## 3. Stack and why

| Choice | Why |
|---|---|
| TypeScript on Node 22 | One language for bot, web, MCP and scheduler; strong typing for tool inputs. |
| `node:sqlite` | Built in, no native build step on Windows or in Docker; enough for pending actions and usage logs. |
| `grammy` | Small, well typed Telegram library with inline buttons for approvals. |
| OpenAI-compatible client | Keeps the model swappable (price/quality) with a base URL and a model name. |
| Official MCP SDK | Standard way to expose tools to other agents. |

## 4. Step-by-step build log

| Step | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project scaffold, typed config, tests | Fail fast on bad configuration; each feature checks only the secrets it needs. |
| 2 | Read-only GitHub client (`list_open_prs`, `get_pr`) | Grounding starts here: every result carries its `sourceUrl`; PR text is truncated and treated as untrusted; CI that cannot be fetched is reported as unknown (`null`), never as passing; a reviewer's later plain comment does not erase their approval. Uses plain `fetch` + zod instead of Octokit to keep dependencies small and responses validated. |

| 3 | GitHub write methods; SQLite store; approval service | **No approval, no action** is enforced in one place (`ApprovalService`), not in the prompt. The model can only *propose*, which writes a pending row and never calls GitHub. Approving atomically moves `pending -> executing` (`UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending' AND expires_at > now`), so double taps or two approvers cannot post twice. The text posted is read from the stored row, so it is exactly what the approver saw. Approval rights are a fixed allowlist, separate from "who may chat". Proposals expire after 24h and at most 20 can wait at once (flood protection). |

### Failure halfway through an approved action (design, step 3)

Each posted comment carries a hidden marker `<!-- pr-triage-agent:<id> -->`.

- GitHub answered with a 4xx: nothing happened -> `failed`, the user is told nothing was posted and may propose again.
- No response or a 5xx: we **do not guess**. We search the PR's comments for the marker. Found -> `executed` (no duplicate). Lookup works but nothing found -> `failed`. Lookup also fails -> `uncertain`, and the user is told to check the PR before retrying.

### Trade-off: `node:sqlite`

It is still flagged experimental in Node 22 (prints a warning), but it needs no native build, which removes a whole class of Windows/Docker deployment problems. The storage access is behind two small files (`store/db.ts`, `store/actions.ts`), so swapping it for `better-sqlite3` would be a contained change.
